Simple to use ~~(not simple at all!)~~ Dropbox backup plugin for PocketMine-MP.

# Installation

First, You need to create your `own` app on [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/developers)

For details, please refer to the following link: [Link](https://docs.gravityforms.com/creating-a-custom-dropbox-app/)

After getting the API token, write the token in the token section in plugin_data/DropBoxBackUp/config.yml file.

After restarting the server, type `/db` in the console to start the backup.

Sorry for my bad english :wink:
